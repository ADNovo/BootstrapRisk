**Abstract**

This work focuses on the, to our best knowledge, first application and backtesting of
the bootstrap methods in GARCH models of Pascual et al. (2006) and Chen et al. (2011)
to the estimation of value-at-risk and expected shortfall, using data from the FTSE 100
index, as well as the comparison of their performance with the ones of the Filtered Historical
Simulation and Historical Simulation. The accurate estimation of these risk measures
is significantly relevant to the risk management decisions of financial institutions,
as well as to fulfill the regulatory requirements, such as the ones imposed by the Basel II
Accords. Previous existing methods have some limitations, such not including the uncertainty
due to parameter estimation. In addition to the computational costs of the method
developed by Chen et al. (2011) being 100 times lower than the one of Pascual et al.
(2006), the former assumes a symmetric conditional return distribution, which, according
to the empirical application developed in this work, seems to have a positive impact on
the accuracy of the risk measures generated. Moreover, both methods seem to outperform
the Historical Simulation and the Filtered Historical Simulation, as the former imposes
unnecessary capital requirements to financial institutions, while the latter fails to predict
extreme losses.
